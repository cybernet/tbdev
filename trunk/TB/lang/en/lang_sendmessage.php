You may have noticed, if you have visited the forum, that TB is disabling the accounts of all users with low share ratios.\n
I am sorry to say that your ratio is a little too low to be acceptable.\n
If you would like your account to remain open, you must ensure that your ratio increases dramatically in the next day or two, to get as close to 1.0 as possible.\n
I am sure that you will appreciate the importance of sharing your downloads.
You may PM any Moderator, if you believe that you are being treated unfairly.\n
Thank you for your cooperation.",

You may not be aware that there are new guidelines on avatar sizes in the [url={$TBDEV['baseurl']}/rules.php]rules[/url], in particular \"Resize
your images to a width of 150 px and a size of [b]no more than 150 KB[/b].\"\n
I'm sorry to say your avatar doesn't conform to them. Please change it as soon as possible.\n
We understand this may be an inconvenience to some users but feel it is in the community's best interest.\n
Thanks for the cooperation.",
