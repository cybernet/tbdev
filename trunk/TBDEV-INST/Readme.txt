Tbdev Pre-Coded Auto Installer By Bigjoos

Ok after much deliberation over whether this project was viable or not i have spent over a year looking at new members help requests and checking most mod install help requests 
in doing so i noticed a big gulf in knowledge so i thought well Tbdev can be a hard install if you dont know much php/html/css/mysql infact i know when i first looked 
at TBdev code i was completely overwhelmed and made major mistakes.

Well from sticking in and reading certain coders post who i have the upmost respect for i started to see where i was messing up and i havint looked back since - Tbdev is a 
gold mine of information if your prepared to look for it so thank you all on tbdev because from me to coldfusion to laffin - snuggs down to members and advanced members 
theres code and idea's and slight improvements from everyone all thrown together to produce a ready to run site.

I expect this code to fully rule out people wanting to buy a certain source code - why ? why pay when you can have as good free ?
I expect coders of intermediate level to be comfy with this within hours of install - why ? i commented majority of the big mods that have high query demands so you can comment out 
and go back to default code settings to your preference really.
I expect new coders to have no problem as long as they study the structure as this has a lot of changes compared to tbdev 01.01.08.

I've run the core code used here with 9500 members at one point without having any major problems to speak of but this is slighty different so i cant give any limit untill its tested for real.

Invite2 has a little mod i was messing with - it generates a loginkey - so the site has a hidden login spot - your url generated is var32 like passkey - one letter wrong its sorry pal not found
so when you confirm your invite you use your login url - im not sure if its good bad but it works with login2.php/takelogin2.php takeinvite2.php ect .. all the 2's lol.. so it can be tested alongside normal login.

i need to ask retro if he minds his php file edit log being used as its from the lounge so it wont be going in if he requests that same with any thing i guess - just send me back what you think and i'll make all the 
nesscary changes
